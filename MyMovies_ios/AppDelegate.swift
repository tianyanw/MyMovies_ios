* Purpose: This project is a multiple view iOS app for managing MovieDescriptions. It uses more complex controls and multiple views to display and manage a collection of MovieDescription objects. It provide a list of all movie titles contained in the collection and allow the user to select one title and see all of the information about that title, and it provide the ability to add or remove movie description entries. New descriptions can be added to the collection by the user manually entering the appropriate information needed to create a MovieDescription object
